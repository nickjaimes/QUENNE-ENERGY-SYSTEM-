Executive Summary: The QUENNE Energy System (QES)

This specification outlines a decentralized energy ecosystem. It is not a single generator but a network of thousands of distributed, electromagnetically-based energy harvesters. These harvesters are orchestrated by a hierarchical AI control system (the QUENNE layers) to provide reliable, sustainable, and intelligent power for smart city sensors and electric vehicle range extension.

1. Human Authority & Ethics Layer (The TRIAD)

This layer defines the operational boundaries and system goals, ensuring all technical decisions serve a higher purpose.

· Technical Mandate:
  · Safety (Protective Intelligence): All grid-tied components must comply with IEEE 1547 (Standard for Interconnection and Interoperability of Distributed Energy Resources with Associated Electric Power Systems Interfaces). This includes automatic anti-islanding protection, which shuts down the generator if the main grid goes down, preventing electrocution risks to line workers.
  · Sustainability (Ethical Intelligence): Material selection is prioritized for a "Circular Economy." The use of rare-earth magnets (like Neodymium) must be minimized or certified for recycling at end-of-life. The system design must favor readily recyclable materials like copper and specific grades of steel.
  · Equity (Strategic Intelligence): The AI is programmed to prioritize power distribution in a way that prevents "energy archipelagos" where wealthy districts thrive while others are starved. The grid management algorithm includes a fairness variable in its optimization function.

2. Nuclear Intelligence (Grid Domain Control)

This is the top-level AI that treats the entire Smart City grid as a single, complex organism.

· Technical Specifications:
  · Control Algorithm: A hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) system, similar to those validated for wind energy systems .
  · Function: Processes real-time data (weather, traffic, time of day, energy pricing) to forecast energy demand and availability from thousands of distributed harvesters. It issues strategic commands (e.g., "Enter standby mode," "Begin charging storage banks") to the lower-level controllers to maintain grid stability (voltage and frequency within ±1%).
  · Key Performance Indicator (KPI): Achieves 99.9% accuracy in state estimation (voltage, torque, speed) using advanced filters like the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), even with noisy sensor data .

3. Atomic Fusion & Booster Fusion Algorithms (Localized Intelligence)

This is the "brain" of each individual generator or small cluster. It handles real-time optimization and performance scaling.

A. Atomic Fusion Algorithm (Multi-Model Cognitive Fusion Engine)

This controller fuses data from multiple local sensors (vibration, displacement, temperature) to manage the core energy conversion process.

· Application in Smart City Harvester (Crank-Shaft Design):
  · Input Sensing: Measures vertical displacement (0-25 mm) and speed of the top plate .
  · Control Action: Dynamically adjusts the external load resistance to match the optimal impedance of the generator (e.g., 35.5 Ω), ensuring maximum power transfer regardless of traffic conditions .
· Application in Vehicle Generator (Linear/Regenerative Suspension Design):
  · Input Sensing: Monitors suspension oscillation frequency and amplitude.
  · Control Action: Tunes the electrical damping of the generator to either maximize energy harvest (on rough roads) or provide a comfortable ride (on smooth highways). It acts as a semi-active suspension system .

B. Booster Fusion Algorithm (Adaptive Performance & Capability Scaling)

This algorithm pushes the physical hardware to its limits safely and adapts to changing conditions.

· Technical Function: Performs Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) on a mechanical level. It identifies the optimal operating point for the generator.
· Vehicle Application: For a regenerative shock absorber, the algorithm uses data to identify the resonant frequency of the suspension. It then adjusts the generator's field or load to maximize the oscillatory motion, thereby boosting power generation, which can reach up to an estimated 64 watts per wheel on a full-scale system at highway speeds, and significantly more on rough terrain .
· Control Hardware: Executed on a local microcontroller (e.g., an ARM Cortex-M4) running a real-time operating system for deterministic response times (< 1ms).

4. Core Engineering & Physical Specifications

This layer details the tangible components that convert kinetic energy into electrical power.

A. Smart City Infrastructure Harvester (Crank-Shaft / Linear Design)

· Primary Technology: Electromagnetic induction via a crank mechanism or linear motion .
· Mechanical Design:
  · Vertical Displacement: Designed for minimal road impact, with a maximum travel of 25 mm, allowing it to be integrated into rumble strips or smooth speed bumps .
  · Spring System: High-cycle fatigue-resistant steel springs to return the plate to position after each vehicle pass.
· Generator Unit:
  · Type: Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) or a specialized linear generator.
  · Pole/Slot Configuration: For a tubular linear generator, research shows that increasing pole and slot counts significantly boosts output. A 16-pole/16-slot configuration is optimal for high power density, capable of generating over 579W in a suspension-style application, which can be scaled down for road applications .
  · Performance:
    · Peak Power Pulse: Can generate power pulses of up to 4.36 W from a single vehicle pass at low speeds (under 30 mph), enough to power multiple IoT sensors .
    · Continuous Power: Capable of supplying on-demand power for LED lighting, traffic monitoring cameras, and V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication nodes.
    · Optimal Load: The external power harvesting circuit should present an optimal resistance of ~35.5 Ω to maximize energy capture .
· Energy Storage: Local supercapacitors or solid-state batteries for energy buffering before transmission to the grid or local consumption.

B. Vehicle Energy Generator (Regenerative Suspension / Linear Generator)

· Primary Technology: A linear generator integrated into the vehicle's shock absorber .
· Magnetic Assembly (Translator/Magnet Stack):
  · Magnets: High-energy product Neodymium (NdFeB) magnets, e.g., Grade N42 or higher.
  · Configuration: Magnets arranged in a specific axial orientation (e.g., NS-NS) to focus and direct magnetic flux. Research indicates that a "Vertical" or "Planar-Vertical" magnetic pole array can increase power output by 2 to 784 times compared to sub-optimal configurations by maximizing the Lorentz force .
  · Spacers: Ring-shaped, high-magnetically-permeable spacers (e.g., pure iron or electrical steel) placed between magnets to further concentrate flux into the coils .
· Coil Assembly (Stator):
  · Material: High-purity copper windings.
  · Configuration: Multi-phase windings (typically 3-phase) housed in a non-magnetic tube (e.g., Delrin or aluminum) to reduce eddy current losses . For a 100W-class target, specific slot-pole combinations like 12-pole/12-slot are analyzed for optimal power density and low cogging force .
· Performance Metrics:
  · Power Output: A full-scale, optimized linear generator for a vehicle suspension can achieve significant power.
    · 8-pole/8-slot: ~366.5 W
    · 12-pole/12-slot: ~466.7 W
    · 16-pole/16-slot: ~579.7 W 
  · Typical Driving Harvest: At ~45 mph on a regular road, a system could harvest 2-8 W per shock, scaling to ~256 W for the whole vehicle .
  · Voltage Output: Raw AC voltage is variable and frequency-dependent, requiring rectification and conditioning.

5. Digital Backbone (Linux Core & Cross-Platform Abstraction)

This is the nervous system, connecting every physical generator to the wider network.

· Linux Core Algorithm:
  · Hardware: A secure, embedded system-on-module (SoM) running a real-time Linux kernel (e.g., PREEMPT_RT) on each generator cluster or vehicle gateway.
  · Function: Runs the local Atomic and Booster Fusion algorithms. Handles secure communication (TLS 1.3) with the central grid. Manages local data logging and diagnostics.
· Cross-Platform Abstraction Layer:
  · Protocol: All devices, regardless of underlying hardware (ARM for vehicle controllers, x86 for grid servers, RISC-V for future IoT sensors), communicate using a standardized data model based on a common framework like IEEE 2030.5 (Smart Energy Profile).
  · API: A unified RESTful API or MQTT protocol ensures that any generator, from a 4W road harvester to a 500W vehicle damper, reports data and receives commands in a uniform, platform-agnostic way.
